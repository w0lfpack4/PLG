## About PLG

Profession Leveling Guide (PLG) is an in-game, load on demand guide to help you level your professions faster.  The addon loads with the WoW professions tradeskills window.  PLG will suggest a recipe that uses the fewest or cheapest materials that will give you the most skillups.  It will tell you what to make, how many to make, if you need to keep them for the next recipe, where to get the recipe, and when to see your trainer.  No complicated setup, no options, just load and go.

## New In This Release

* Updated blacksmithing data. 
* Added button to clear reagent tracking database.  
* Fixed bug when PLG stops updating, or when Smelting window is opened.
